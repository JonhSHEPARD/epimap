# Map Contributing:

## Edit Maps:

Here is the process to update maps properly:

1. Open SVG in Inkscape (or AdoBe Illustrator) 
2. Update the map (tutorial: )
3. Save file, close your editing software and open the file in your favorite text editor
4. Check for width and height properties in svg header: values should be "100%"

This last point is mandatory to pass CD workflow action and then be merged and deployed

- Indoor walls are 3px thick.
- Others strokes (doors, stairs) are 0.8-1px thick
